# e-AR (EAR) PROJECT - EMERGENCY VENTILATOR
This project was born because of CoVid19 pandemic.
The project Goal is to provide an emergency ventilator system to help CoVid19 serious cases using locally available resources. eAR was designed to meet specifications according to MIT E-Vent (USA) and MHRA (UK) - Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System.
This is an OPEN HARDWARE - OPEN SOURCE PROJECT. 

DISCLAIMER: we will NOT take any responsability on devices built using partial or total information from this project. 
Any device used for life support and medical applications must meet all local requirements and they must be homologated by local regulatory agencies in ANY case.

The target is to run an entire ventilation system using an automotive car battery and an O2 can.
The initial project leader is Celso Ken Mori Monteiro, automotive designer with +30 yrs experience on automotive embedded systems
as OEM designer for customers as GM, Ford, VW, Fiat, Mercedes Benz, Scania, Navistar, Marcopolo, Agco...

The technology for first PCBs was downsized due to components availability in emerging countries so distributed production could be achieved even in small brazilian towns. The electronic parts are:
- PTH components
- Single-sided PCB, obtainable even by DIYs.

Basic concepts:
- FIO2 O2 + AIR mixer based on timed mechanical truck air valves and plastic bag container
- AMBU smasher based on car window motor due to availabilty and great mechanical characteristics
- ECU based on Arduino Pro Mini (the most available in emerging countries) and SPI based IO expension
- 2 motor drive options: relay (need second adjustable supply or buck) and PWM driven mosfet driver

Current Project Status:
- full HW schematics and system component's description available on "EAR System Developer's HW Guide", portuguese only version
- PCB Gerbers available, Single Side PTH version, Motor driver on relay option only. Time and size were underestimated because we no longer use these old technologies. Released on March 30, 2020.
- Mech prototype phase 2 aproved, torque is OK and current is low.
- Gerbers of single sided boards on PTH components published on March 30, 2020. Time and size were underestimated because we no longer use these old technologies. 
- EAR System Developer's SW Guide released on March 30, 2020.
- Functional electronics prototype built and delivered on April 2, 2020. No changes in PCBs are necessary except hardware end-of-courses provided for EAR ECU Motor Driver Board. Test driven by firmware FW00 - focused on HW testing only. Reads input pots, control motor with reversal action, measures motor current and tests IO expansion board. All items are functional.
- FW00 published in April 3, 2020.
- Added Mosfet-based PWM Motor Driver and Absolute position sensor using a car fuel level sensor.
- First working mechanical+electrical prototype delivered in April 6, 2020.
- Added Pressure Sensor in April 7, 2020. First artificial lung is a balloon so first pressure profile was obtained. It Sounds promising.
- Firmware controls Tidal Volume and BPM according to Set Potentiometers. First functional firmware produce variable pressure ramps as needed, FW met 8-30 BPM dynamic range specification.
- Added motor cutoff in inspiratory phase according to pressure preset on pot Overpressure Threshold within 1cm H20 resolution.
- Added full mechanical design for functional AMBU compressing ARM in April 11, 2020
- Added in April 12, 2020: Motor Driver, mosfet NN version. Full Kicad design with schematics, PCB and Gerbers.
- Added in April 12,2020: eAR External watchdog Timer to increase eAR reliability. Full Eagle design with schematics, PCB and Gerbers.
- Added in April 13,2020: I/E selection (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4) and Plateau Hold Time selection (150, 250, 500 and 1000ms hold on Plateau)
- Added in April 13,2020: Gol G3 tank level float sensor added as absolute position sensor. Increased linearity, resolution and availability
- Mech proto 3.2 added ball bearing in compression arm, currently performing cycling tests
- Added in April 21,2020: 10x10cm FR4 SMT single PCB design for volume production, unverified

Pending:
- Mechanical proto 3.2 drawings expected for Week 17
- Assisted Ventilation Firmware expected for Week 17
