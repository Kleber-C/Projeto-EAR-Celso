Basic concepts:
- FIO2 O2 + AIR mixer based on timed mechanical truck air valves and plastic bag container
- AMBU smasher based on car window motor due to availabilty and great mechanical characteristics
- ECU based on Arduino Pro Mini (the most available in emerging countries) and SPI based IO expension
